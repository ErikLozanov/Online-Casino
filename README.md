I'm currently working solo on an exciting project: an Online Casino featuring roulette and slots. The entire system is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend: **React**
- Backend: **MongoDB server** for data storage and a **WebSocket server** for real-time communication.

## Features
The Online Casino includes the following key features:

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system to ensure a safe and personalized experience.
- **Login/Register:** Users can easily create accounts or log in to access the casino's features.

## Project Status
